Project Name: Bewakoof.com Clone

Description:
I developed a static clone of the popular e-commerce website Bewakoof.com to showcase my frontend development skills. This project demonstrates my ability to create visually 
appealing and responsive web interfaces using HTML and CSS.

Features:

- Home Page: A visually engaging landing page featuring a dynamic layout similar to Bewakoof.com, including banners, product highlights, and promotional sections.
- Product Pages: Detailed product pages designed to display items with images, descriptions, and pricing information, closely mirroring the original siteâ€™s style.
- Navigation: A user-friendly navigation bar that allows seamless browsing through different sections of the website, including categories like men, women, and accessories.
- Responsive Design: Ensured that the website is fully responsive, providing a consistent user experience across various devices, from desktops to mobile phones.

Technologies Used:

-HTML: Structured the content of the web pages, including elements like headers, footers, product listings, and navigation menus.
-CSS: Styled the web pages to match the aesthetic of Bewakoof.com, using CSS techniques such as Flexbox and Grid for layout, along with custom fonts and color schemes to enhance the visual appeal.
Challenges and Learning:

Design Consistency: Replicating the design elements of Bewakoof.com required careful attention to detail to ensure consistency in fonts, colors, and layout.
Responsive Design: Implementing a responsive design taught me how to use media queries and flexible grid systems to adapt the layout for different screen sizes.
This project helped me improve my skills in front-end development and deepened my understanding of responsive web design. Although it is not a functional e-commerce site, it serves as a solid foundation for developing fully functional web applications in the future
